# Game Rules

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their **ROUND score**.  
BUT, if the player rolls a **1**, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it’s the next player’s turn.  
The player can choose to **Hold**, which means their ROUND score gets added to their score. After that, it’s the next player’s turn.  
The first player to reach **20  points** on their GLOBAL score wins the game.
